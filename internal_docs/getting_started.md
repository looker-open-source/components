# Design Contribution

One of the core tenants of Lens is to encourage contribution. Designers should feel empowered to share and propose new components and styles they feel will benefit the team. Heres how to propose a new component:

#### Step One: Propose

Lens team uses Github to track issues. To propose an update to the team library or a component, create a [github issue](https://github.com/looker/lens) in the Lens repository and include the following: 

1. A link to the figma file with a component example
2. Include a figma link in the [github issue](#https://github.com/looker/lens)
3. A brief description of the new components behavior, states, and use case. 

#### Step Two: Review & Revise
Creating an issue informs the team that you are ready for the review process. We review your proposal based on the following criteria:

1. A well defined spec (e.g. spacing, styling, state)
2. Proper naming and architecture 
3. Accessibility & localization considerations

Please note: Issues will be responded to within 24 hours or the next business day.

#### Step Three: Publish & Socialize
 
1. If you already have a github issue, add additional notes, design updates, specifications and apply engineering label tag to your issue. 
2. Publish your component to the team asset library in figma
3. Share your new component and updated github issue on the [Lens](#) slack channel to let everyone know its ready to use.
