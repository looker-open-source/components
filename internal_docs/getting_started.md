# Design Contribution

### How to Start Contributing

One of the core tenants of Lens is to encourage contribution. Designers should feel empowered to share and propose new components and styles they feel will benefit the team. Heres how to propose a new contribution

#### Step One: Propose

Lens team uses Github to track issues. To propose an update to the team library or a component, create a [github issue](https://github.com/looker/lens) in the Lens repository and include the following: 

1. A link to the figma file with a component example
2. Include a screenshot of the component in the the [github issue](#https://github.com/looker/lens)
3. A brief description of the new component

#### Step Two: Review & Revise
Filing an issue triggers a review process to make sure the proposal meets Lens standards including:

1. A well defined spec (e.g. spacing, styling, state)
2. Proper naming and architecture 
3. Accessibility & localization considerations

#### Step Three: Publish & Socialize
 
1. Update github issue and apply engineering label tag to your issue
2. Publish it to the team asset library in figma
3. Post to the [#Design](#) & [#Lens](#) channel on slack
