# Playground

We strongly encourage using [Storybook](../storybook/README.md) where possible instead of the playground.

Playground can be used construct and test new components. Playground may be more useful in cases where you need to access data from third party APIs.

To boot this package run the following command from the monorepo root:

- `yarn playground`

This will boot webpack and watch this folder for changes to any `.tsx` files here-in.
