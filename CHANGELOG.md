## [0.7.23] - 2020-03-09

- # new component `InlineInputText` plus documentations and test

### Fixed

- `usePopover` issue where the next click after a popover closes is canceled

## [0.7.20] - 2020-02-25

### Fixed

- `usePopover` event handlers not getting properly cleaned up

## [0.7.19] - 2020-02-24

### Added

- `InlineInputText` component
- `Select` now supports grouped options with a `title` and option `description`, as well as `FlexboxProps` for layout styling.

### Changed

- `Select` now only defaults to the first option if neither `placeholder` nor `isClearable` is defined.

### Fixed

- Corrected links to source in documentation
- `Select` styling issues when `GlobalStyle` is not used, missing down caret icon in documentation
- `usePopover`, when the toggle was a mousedown event, would open just before the "click outside" listener was able to close any prior popovers. If both popovers were inside a `Modal`, the closing popover would re-enable the parent scroll lock, and the one that just opened would be un-scrollable. This especially affected multiple `Select`s inside a `Modal`.
