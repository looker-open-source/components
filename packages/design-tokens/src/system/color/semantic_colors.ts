/**
 * Defines color values for specific color groups.
 *
 * SemanticColors is one part of a two part color system, which also includes
 * Palette. The values defined here can be thought of as color groups that may
 * be used directly by components.
 *
 * Each SemanticColor should define the full set of possible color values, such
 * as main, linkColor, etc so that a color objects can be interchanged without
 * error across components.
 *
 * Some components accept entire color groups to define their appearance.
 * <Button/> is a good example of this.
 *
 * This idea is borrowed directly from the Office UI Fabric component
 * implementation:
