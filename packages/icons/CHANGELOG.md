# [1.0.0](https://github.com/looker-open-source/components/compare/v0.18.0...v1.0.0) (2021-03-22)

- **Icon**: Changes how Icons are used within @looker/components, shipped within @looker/components and leveraged by downstream consumers.

Fundamentally this changes icons from being a key/name (e.g.: "Calendar") to an SVG or component `<Calendar />`. Looker Components now leverages [Styled Icons](https://github.com/styled-icons/styled-icons) to provide types and design patterns as well as providing a complete set of "stock" Google Material icons.
