# Styled Components

[Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/) is a low level CSS
library used by Lens.

> 👋 Heads up! 👋
>
> **You should rarely need to use Styled Components.** Instead use the [`<Box/>`](/layout/box)
> component and its props which ensures you use Lens' theme values and
> stay within the Lens style guidelines. Styled Components should only be
> used for configuring [pseudo classes (eg `:hover`)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes), [pseudo elements (eg
> `:before`)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements), animations, or rarely when `<Box/>`'s properties are insufficient.

### Things You'll Learn

- Use Styled Components' `styled` function for styling pseudo classes and pseudo
  elements.
- Strip props out before passing them to lower level components to avoid runtime
  errors.
- Styled Components provides access to a component's prop values so styling can
  be computed dynamically.

## Styling a Lens Component

Let's pretend we want to build a new kind of `<Link>` that renders visited links
a bit differently. Our designer has laid out the following specs:

1.  Visited links should render red.
2.  The component should accept a prop called `visited` that renders the text as
    strike-through on hover.

To handle this, we'll use Styled Components' `styled` function because we'll
need to style both the `:visited` and `:hover` pseudo classes. Step one is to
set the `:visited` color to our palette.red400 color. We can access the Theme
via Styled Components, so this is easy enough:

```jsx
import { Link } from '@looker/components'

const VisitedLink = styled(Link)`
  :visited {
    color: ${props => props.theme.colors.palette.red400};
  }
`
```

<Playground>
  <VisitedLink href="https://www.google.com">Google.com</VisitedLink>
</Playground>

Note, `styled` expects to be passed a React component directly. In the example
above, we pass it the `Link` Lens component.

## Styling Child Components and Linter Errors

Styled Components [provides a useful mechanism for styling child components](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/advanced#referring-to-other-components). This syntax, unfortunately, [generates a known linter error](https://github.com/styled-components/stylelint-processor-styled-components/issues/34#issuecomment-325339118). To remove the linter error, simply add the `/* sc-selector */` tag to your style definition. For example:

```jsx
import { styled, Link } from '@looker/components'

const Card = styled.div`
  ${/* sc-selector */ Link} {
    background-color: ${props => props.theme.palette.green300};
  }
`
```
