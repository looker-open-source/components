## Composition

Looker UI Components (and React) rely heavily on the concept of composition, where smaller components can be composed to create higher-order behavior. In the `SpaceCard` example above the `Card`, `CardContent` and `Heading` are composed to define a what it means to display a Space object in Card format.

## Extending behavior

In some cases we may not support the exact presentation or behavior necessary. Through composition and styling, most components can be extended and customized. Here's an example of a new LoggerButton that logs every click:

```jsx static
import React from 'react'
import {
  Button as BaseButton,
  ButtonProps as BaseButtonProps,
} from '@looker/components'

const logHandler = (event: React.MouseEvent<HTMLElement>) => {
  logger(event.target.value)
}

export const LoggerButton: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({ onClick, ...props }) => {
  let clickHandler = logHandler
  if (onClick !== undefined) {
    clickHandler = (event: React.MouseEvent<HTMLElement>) => {
      logHandler(event)
      if (onClick) onClick(event)
    }
  }

  return (
    <Button onClick={clickHandler} {...props}>
      {props.children}
    </Button>
  )
}
```

## Extending styling

Styling can also be extended, but care is needed to ensure you do not violate Looker's design principles.

```jsx static
import { Button } from '@looker/components'
import styled from 'styled-components'

const CircularButton = styled(Button)`
  border-radius: 4rem;
`

<CircularButton>+</CircularButton>
```
