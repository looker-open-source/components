title: Theme
---

To help stay within Looker's design principles, [we publish a theme object](https://github.com/looker-open-source/components/blob/master/packages/design-tokens/src/theme.ts), along with libraries, like Styled Components and styled-system, to easily access the theme object within components. For example, when styling components using the `styled` function, the theme object becomes part of a component's props:

## ThemeProvider

Looker Components require that a Styled Components `ThemeProvider` be available and that theme specified have the same structure that is provided by Looker Component's stock `theme` object. See below for information on extending the stock theme for your own use case.

NOTE: For the sake of brevity examples within the documentation generally don't show the ThemeProvider. It's injected as part of the site's code sandbox setup.

```jsx
;() => {
  /**
   *  import { Button, theme } from '@looker/components'
   *  import { ThemeProvider } from 'styled-components'
   **/

  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <Button>Just a regular button</Button>
    </ThemeProvider>
  )
}
```

You can use the theme's properties within your custom components:

```jsx
;() => {
  /**
   *  import { Button, theme } from '@looker/components'
   *  import styled, { ThemeProvider } from 'styled-components'
   **/

  const DangerButton = styled(Button)`
    border-color: ${(props) => props.theme.colors.palette.red500};
    background-color: ${(props) => props.theme.colors.palette.red500};
  `

  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <DangerButton>Danger Wil Robinson!</DangerButton>
    </ThemeProvider>
  )
}
```

## Extending the Theme

You can extend the theme provided by Looker Components by creating a copy and then providing that version of theme to the ThemeProvider.

```jsx
;() => {
  /**
   *  import { Button, theme } from '@looker/components'
   *  import styled, { ThemeProvider } from 'styled-components'
   **/

  const myTheme = {
    ...theme,
    myCustomAttribute: 'hotpink',
  }

  const PrettyButton = styled(Button)`
    border-color: ${(props) => props.theme.myCustomAttribute};
    background-color: ${(props) => props.theme.myCustomAttribute};
  `

  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={myTheme}>
      <PrettyButton>Pink is so Pretty!</PrettyButton>
    </ThemeProvider>
  )
}
```

## Nesting ThemeProviders

Styled Components' ThemeProvider acts as a React Context and in so doing is able to support the standard behavior of nested contexts - the theme defined nearest to the component will be the version used.

NOTE: You'll also see that `PrettyButton` in the example simply falls back to `Button`'s default style when `myCustomAttribute` isn't assigned.

```jsx
;() => {
  /**
   *  import { Button, theme } from '@looker/components'
   *  import styled, { ThemeProvider } from 'styled-components'
   **/

  const myTheme = {
    ...theme,
    myCustomAttribute: 'hotpink',
  }

  const PrettyButton = styled(Button)`
    border-color: ${(props) => props.theme.myCustomAttribute};
    background-color: ${(props) => props.theme.myCustomAttribute};
  `

  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <PrettyButton mr="large">Stock Theme</PrettyButton>

      <ThemeProvider theme={myTheme}>
        <PrettyButton>Pretty Button with Custom Theme</PrettyButton>
      </ThemeProvider>
    </ThemeProvider>
  )
}
```
