## Add NPM Package

To add Looker UI Components to your project, add the [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@looker/components) to your project:

```bash static
# Looker projects generally utilize Yarn (https://yarnpkg.com/)
yarn add @looker/components styled-components react react-dom

# If you prefer you can of course also use NPM directly:
npm install @looker/components styled-components
```

### Using Typescript?

If you're using Typescript you'll also need to add the type definitions for Styled Components.

```bash static
yarn add --dev @types/styled-components @types/react @types/react-dom
```

Unfortunately, due to [this issue with the type definitions for Styled Components](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/33311) you'll need to apply a minor workaround if you're using ESLint along with Styled Component's Typescript definitions.

```bash static
rm -R node_modules/@types/react-native
echo '@types/react-native' > .yarnclean
```

## Using a Component

Now that we have `@looker/components` installed we can start using them in our application. To get things started import some components:

```jsx static
import { Card, theme } from '@looker/components'
import { ThemeProvider } from 'styled-components'

<ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
  <Card>{Source here...}</Card>
</ThemeProvider>
```

Which could be used to render the following:

```jsx
<Card raised>
  <CardContent>
    <Heading fontWeight="semiBold" textTransform="capitalize">
      Welcome to Looker Components
    </Heading>
    <Text>Looker's component library</Text>
  </CardContent>
</Card>
```

Try editing the code above, you should see the changes appear live.

These live editing blocks are found throughout our style guide documentation, providing a space for rapid experimentation with components.
