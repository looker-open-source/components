title: Writing Components the Lens Way
---

Lens is built using the following language and libraries:

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html)
- [StyledComponents](https://www.styled-components.com/)
- [styled-system](https://github.com/jxnblk/styled-system)

You **don't** have to be an expert in all of those technologies to start using Lens today, but it's good to have an understanding about why they were chosen and how they are employed inside Lens when writing new Lens components.

The following technologies roughly form a "stack", in that each layer is used by the next to solve a more specific problem:

### React & Typescript

React is a Javascript library that makes it easy to build UI components as simple functions and classes.

Lens is written in Typescript, which provides a structural static type system, allowing Lens components to define strict, enforceable interfaces.

### Styled Components

Styled Components is a css-in-js library that allows developers to write styling in Typescript and couple it directly to a component. There are pros and cons to using CSS in this way. If you want to learn more about this approach [this talk is highly recommended](https://speakerdeck.com/vjeux/react-css-in-js).

Styled Components also provides a Theme object which allows entire applications to adhere to a consistent style guide.

```jsx static
interface PersonProps {
  title: string
  age: number
}

const BasePersonDetail = (propsOf: PersonProps) => {
  return (
    <Box>
      <Heading>{props.name}</Heading>
      <Text>Age: {props.age}</Text>
    </Box>
  )
}

const PersonDetail = styled<PersonProps>(BasePersonDetail)`
  border: 2px solid black;
`
```

### styled-system

styled-system is a Styled Components helper library that provides some nice functions for tying parts of the theme object to properties on components. The entire library, and its types, are exported from Lens for use in Looker projects.

```jsx static
import { space, SpaceProps } from 'looker-design-tokens'

interface PersonProps extends SpaceProps {
  title: string
  age: number
}

const BasePersonDetail = (propsOf: PersonProps) => {
  return (
    <Box>
      <Heading>{props.name}</Heading>
      <Text>Age: {props.age}</Text>
    </Box>
  )
}

// `space` adds some margin and padding properties to the underlying component
// which are tied into the theme object. See SpaceProps and Box.tsx for good examples.
const PersonDetail = styled<PersonProps>(BasePersonDetail)`
  ${space}
  border: 2px solid black;
`

// Example use of the resulting component:
<PersonDetail mx={1} person={person} />
```
