The `<Prompt/>` component is similar to the `<Confirm/>` component in that you can use either to render a modal.

However, unlike the `<Confirm/>`, the `<Prompt/>` component comes with a built in `<FieldText/>` input component. This makes it more suitable for use cases where you want to grab user input before performing an action.
