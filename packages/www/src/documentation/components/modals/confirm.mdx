## Confirm

A render-props version, for use in class components.

```jsx
<Confirm
  title="Confirm Something"
  message="Is this what you want to do?"
  onConfirm={close => {
    alert('You did something')
    close()
  }}
>
  {open => <Button onClick={open}>Do Something</Button>}
</Confirm>
```

Updating color and text of the button

```jsx
<Confirm
  confirmLabel="Delete"
  buttonColor="danger"
  title="Delete Something"
  message="Is this what you want to do?"
  onConfirm={close => {
    alert('You deleted something')
    close()
  }}
>
  {open => (
    <Button color="danger" onClick={open}>
      Delete
    </Button>
  )}
</Confirm>
```

## useConfirm

A custom hook that returns the opener function and rendered confirmation dialog. The following example is a complex usage to illustrate how the opener can be called from another hook.

```jsx
;() => {
  function handleConfirm(close) {
    alert('You deleted it')
    close()
  }
  const [confirmation, confirm] = useConfirm({
    confirmLabel: 'Yes, Delete all',
    buttonColor: 'danger',
    title: `Delete all`,
    message: 'Are you sure you want to delete all?',
    onConfirm: handleConfirm,
  })

  return (
    <>
      {confirmation}
      <ButtonOutline onClick={confirm}>useConfirm</ButtonOutline>
    </>
  )
}
```

## Rich Message Content

In addition to strings, `Confirm` also supports passing in a react component for the message content. This allows for richer formatting and fine-grained control of the message.

```jsx
;() => {
  /*
   * import { Confirm, Flex, FlexItem, Icon, Paragraph, Link } from '@looker/components'
   * import styled from 'styled-components'
   */

  const RichMessage = () => (
    <Flex>
      <FlexItem>
        <Icon
          mr="large"
          name="CircleInfoOutline"
          size="80px"
          color="palette.purple400"
        />
      </FlexItem>
      <FlexItem>
        <Paragraph>
          Canadians say "sorry" so often that{' '}
          <strong>in 2009 a law was passed</strong> declaring that an apology
          cannot be used as an admission of guilt.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph mt="xsmall" variant="subdued" fontSize="small">
          <cite>
            SOURCE:{' '}
            <Link
              href="https://www.theloop.ca/canadians-love-to-say-sorry-so-much-we-had-to-make-this-law/"
              target="_blank"
            >
              the loop
            </Link>
          </cite>
        </Paragraph>
      </FlexItem>
    </Flex>
  )

  return (
    <Confirm
      title="Did you know?"
      message={<RichMessage />}
      onConfirm={close => {
        alert('Now you know.')
        close()
      }}
    >
      {open => <Button onClick={open}>Do something fancy</Button>}
    </Confirm>
  )
}
```
