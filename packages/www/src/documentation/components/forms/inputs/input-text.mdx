# Input Text

<ComponentDetail

### Default InputText

The `<InputText />` component renders a single text input element on the page, with no accompanying label. It is generally used to construct higher-order components like the `<FieldText />`. If you are building a form, you probably want to use `<FieldText />` instead as it provides label and validation support.

<Playground>
  <InputText />
</Playground>

### Name and ID

A name and ID can be specified in the `<InputText />` component. Names are important if the input is used in the context of a form, in which case a name is required for the value of the input to be captured.

<Playground>
  <InputText name="someName" id="someId" />
</Playground>

### Disabled Property

Use the disable property to make an input field uneditable.

<Playground>
  <React.Fragment>
    <InputText disabled />
    <InputText value="Hello!" disabled />
  </React.Fragment>
</Playground>

### Placeholders

Placeholders are used to give a hint to the user of the expected value for the input. They should not be used as a complete replacement of labels.

<Playground>
  <InputText placeholder="Enter your text here..." />
</Playground>

### ReadOnly Property

As the name suggests, `readOnly` makes the text uneditable.

<Playground>
  <InputText value="You can't change me." readOnly />
</Playground>

### Required Property

When set for `<InputText />` in the context of a form, the input field must be filled out before submitting the form.

<Playground>
  <form>
    <InputText required />
    <br />
    <br />
    <Button>Submit</Button>
  </form>
</Playground>

# Accessibility

### Best Practices

- Placeholders are not a substitute for labels.
- Use the correct [input type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#Form_%3Cinput%3E_types_) for the required data to get more accessible fields for free.
- See related [ARIA attributes](#related-aria-attributes)

### Markup Expectations

- **Always** use the `<input>` element with the proper `type` attribute for the content, e.g. `<input type="text">` for text content and `<input type"=number">` for numbers.
- **Always** include an unique id on the `<input>` element so it can be referenced by a label `<input type="text" id="first-name">`
- Fields that are required **must have** the `required` attribute: `<input type="text" id="first-name" required>`

### Labeling Expectations

- Use clear and descriptive labels that avoid ambiguity.
- Make required fields obvious.
- **Always** include a descriptive label with each input, the `for` attribute of the label should match the `id` of the input it labels

<Playground>
  <React.Fragment>
    <label htmlFor="first-name">First Name</label>
    <input id="first-name" type="text" />
  </React.Fragment>
</Playground>

- Fields with validations **must have** a the `aria-desrcibedby` attribute to ensure the error message for the field is read by assistive technology.

<Playground>
  <React.Fragment>
    <label htmlFor="first-name">First Name</label>
    <input
      id="first-name"
      type="text"
      aria-describedby="fn-error-message"
      required
    />
    <p id="fn-error-message">This field is required</p>
  </React.Fragment>
</Playground>

### Focus Expectations

- Input fields with `:focus` should have an outline and/or a visible change to show it has focus.
- If the input field with `:focus` has an error, the error should be read by a screen reader

### Keyboard Expectations

- If input has focus, `TAB` and `SHIFT+TAB` should move focus to next focusable element...
- If input has focus the `Enter` key should submit the form.

### Related Aria Attributes

#### `aria-describedby`

Use this to provide a detailed descriptions of a field that contains errors.

<Playground>
  <React.Fragment>
    <label htmlFor="email">Email Address</label>
    <input id="email" type="email" aria-describedby="email-error-message" />
    <p id="email-error-message">Please enter a valid email address</p>
  </React.Fragment>
</Playground>

This would announce "Email Address, edit text. Please enter a valid email address"
