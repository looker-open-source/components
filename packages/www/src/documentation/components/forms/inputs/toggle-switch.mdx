## Default Checkbox

The `<Checkbox />` component renders a single checkbox element on the page, with no accompanying label. It is generally used to construct higher-order components like the `<FieldCheckbox />`. If you are building a form, you probably want to use `<FieldCheckbox />` instead as it provides label support.

import { Label, ToggleSwitch } from '@looker/components'
import { Playground } from 'docz'

The `ToggleSwitch` component is essentially a decorated checkbox that is either toggled on or off. For accessibility reasons you should always provide a label with your toggle switch, you can use the `<FieldToggleSwitch>` component to quickly generate an accessible toggle switch with proper labeling. Its size can be changed using the `size` prop, which accepts px value as a number. Its default size is 20px.

  {() => {
    const [on, setOn] = React.useState(false)
    const handleChange = event => setOn(event.target.checked)
    return (
      <Label htmlFor="switch">
        Toggle Switch
        <ToggleSwitch onChange={handleChange} on={on} id="switch" />
      </Label>
    )
  }}
</Playground>
