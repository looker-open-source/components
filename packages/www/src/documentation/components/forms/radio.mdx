The `<Radio />` component renders a single radio button on the page, with no accompanying label. It is generally used to construct higher-order components like the `<FieldRadio />`. If you are building a form, you probably want to use `<FieldRadio />` instead as it provides label support.

```jsx
<Radio />
```

## Branded Property

The `branded` property turns the background to the theme's primary color when checked.

```jsx
<Radio branded />
```

## Name and ID

A name and ID can be specified in the `<Radio />` component. Radio buttons of the same `name` are considered to be in a 'radio group' and only one radio button in a radio group can be selected at a time.

```jsx
<Radio name="someName" id="one" />
<br />
<Radio name="someName" id="two" />
<br />
<Radio name="someName" id="three" />
```

## Checked Property

The `<Radio />` component accepts the `checked` property, which either sets the radio button as selected or not.

```jsx
<Radio checked={true} readOnly />
<br />
<Radio checked={false} readOnly />
```

## Disabled Property

Use the disable property to gray out the radio button, making it unclickable.

```jsx
<Radio disabled />
<br />
<Radio disabled checked />
```
