The `<Checkbox />` component renders a single checkbox element on the page, with no accompanying label. It is generally used to construct higher-order components like the `<FieldCheckbox />`. If you are building a form, you probably want to use `<FieldCheckbox />` instead as it provides label support.

The `ToggleSwitch` component is essentially a decorated checkbox that is either toggled on or off. For accessibility reasons you should always provide a label with your toggle switch, you can use the `<FieldToggleSwitch>` component to quickly generate an accessible toggle switch with proper labeling. Its size can be changed using the `size` prop, which accepts px value as a number. Its default size is 20px.

```jsx
;() => {
  const [on, setOn] = React.useState(false)
  const handleChange = (event) => setOn(event.target.checked)
  return (
    <Label htmlFor="switch">
      Toggle Switch
      <ToggleSwitch onChange={handleChange} on={on} id="switch" />
    </Label>
  )
}
```
