The `<InputText />` component renders a single text input element on the page, with no accompanying label. It is generally used to construct higher-order components like the `<FieldText />`. If you are building a form, you probably want to use `<FieldText />` instead as it provides label and validation support.

```jsx
<InputText />
```

`InputText` supports iconBefore iconAfter & prefix suffix. Add an icon or character(s) to the begining and/or end of your `InputText`.
If both `IconBefore` and `Prefix`, or `IcanAfter` and `Suffix` is passed an warning will appear in the console and the `inputText` won't be displayed.

```jsx
<Box mb="small">
  <InputText prefix="$"/>
</Box>
<Box mb="small">
  <InputText iconBefore="GearOutline"/>
</Box>
<Box mb="small">
  <InputText suffix="%"/>
</Box>
<Box mb="small">
  <InputText iconAfter="Check"/>
</Box>
<InputText
  iconAfter="Check"
  prefix="$"
  width='480px'
/>
```

## Name and ID

A name and ID can be specified in the `<InputText />` component. Names are important if the input is used in the context of a form, in which case a name is required for the value of the input to be captured.

```jsx
<InputText name="someName" id="someId" />
```

### #Disabled Property

Use the disable property to make an input field uneditable.

```jsx
<InputText disabled />
<InputText value="Hello!" disabled />
```

### Placeholders

Placeholders are used to give a hint to the user of the expected value for the input. They should not be used as a complete replacement of labels.

```jsx
<InputText placeholder="Enter your text here..." />
```

### ReadOnly Property

As the name suggests, `readOnly` makes the text uneditable.

```jsx
<InputText value="You can't change me." readOnly />
```

### Required Property

When set for `<InputText />` in the context of a form, the input field must be filled out before submitting the form.

```jsx
<form>
  <InputText required />
  <br />
  <br />
  <Button>Submit</Button>
</form>
```

## Accessibility

### Best Practices

- Placeholders are not a substitute for labels.
- Use the correct [input type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#Form_%3Cinput%3E_types_) for the required data to get more accessible fields for free.
- See related [ARIA attributes](#related-aria-attributes)

### Markup Expectations

- **Always** use the `<input>` element with the proper `type` attribute for the content, e.g. `<input type="text">` for text content and `<input type"=number">` for numbers.
- **Always** include an unique id on the `<input>` element so it can be referenced by a label `<input type="text" id="first-name">`
- Fields that are required **must have** the `required` attribute: `<input type="text" id="first-name" required>`

### Labeling Expectations

- Use clear and descriptive labels that avoid ambiguity.
- Make required fields obvious.
- **Always** include a descriptive label with each input, the `for` attribute of the label should match the `id` of the input it labels

```jsx
<label htmlFor="first-name">First Name</label>
<input id="first-name" type="text" />
```

- Fields with validations **must have** a the `aria-desrcibedby` attribute to ensure the error message for the field is read by assistive technology.

```jsx
<label htmlFor="first-name">First Name</label>
<input
  id="first-name"
  type="text"
  aria-describedby="fn-error-message"
  required
/>
<p id="fn-error-message">This field is required</p>
```

### Focus Expectations

- Input fields with `:focus` should have an outline and/or a visible change to show it has focus.
- If the input field with `:focus` has an error, the error should be read by a screen reader

### Keyboard Expectations

- If input has focus, `TAB` and `SHIFT+TAB` should move focus to next focusable element...
- If input has focus the `Enter` key should submit the form.

### Related Aria Attributes

#### aria-describedby

Use this to provide a detailed descriptions of a field that contains errors.

```jsx
<label htmlFor="email">Email Address</label>
<input id="email" type="email" aria-describedby="email-error-message" />
<p id="email-error-message">Please enter a valid email address</p>
```

This would announce "Email Address, edit text. Please enter a valid email address"
