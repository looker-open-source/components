The `<Fieldset />` component is used to wrap Field components into meaningful groups. The `legend` property allows for a heading which is by default aligned above and to the left. Using `label` as a props gives, the component associated with it, a larger clickable area since the area where the label is placed also is associated to the component that has the label.

```jsx
<Fieldset legend="Legend">
  <FieldText label="First" />
  <FieldText label="Second" />
  <FieldText label="Third" />
</Fieldset>
<Button>Submit</Button>
```
