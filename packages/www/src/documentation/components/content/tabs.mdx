Tabs expects to receive a TabList with one or more Tab components. TabPanels expects TabPanel(s). Tabs manages the visibility of a single TabPanel based on its internal state.

The order in which elements are placed inside TabList and TabPanels defines the relationship between them. The first Tab is related to the first TabPanel and so on.

To create a disabled Tab add the disabled prop. You must still create a TabPanel for each Tab to keep the index positions in sync.

```jsx
<Tabs>

    <Tab>Dog</Tab>
    <Tab>Cat</Tab>
    <Tab disabled>Human</Tab>
    <Tab>Bird</Tab>

      <Paragraph>
        The domestic dog is a member of the genus Canis (canines), which forms
        part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant:
        terrestrial carnivore. The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa
        as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were first
        domesticated, which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is
        extinct. The dog was the first species to be domesticated and has been
        selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory
        capabilities, and physical attributes.

      <Paragraph>
        The cat (Felis catus) is a small carnivorous mammal. It is the only
        domesticated species in the family Felidae and often referred to as the
        domestic cat to distinguish it from wild members of the family. The cat
        is either a house cat or a farm cat, which are pets, or a feral cat,
        which ranges freely and avoids human contact. A house cat is valued by
        humans for companionship and for its ability to hunt rodents. About 60
        cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.

      <Paragraph>
        Birds, also known as Aves or avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic
        vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the
        laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered
        heart, and a strong yet lightweight skeleton. Birds live worldwide and
        range in size from the 5 cm (2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.75 m (9 ft)
        ostrich. They rank as the world's most numerically successful class of
        tetrapods, with approximately ten thousand living species, more than
        half of these being passerine, or "perching" birds.

## Tab using Hooks

```jsx
;() => {
  const tab = useTabs()
  return (
    <div>
      <TabList {...tab}>
        <Tab>Tab Hook 1</Tab>
        <Tab>Tab Hook 2</Tab>
      </TabList>
      <TabPanels {...tab}>
        <TabPanel>1 this is the panel of tab hook 1</TabPanel>
        <TabPanel>2 this is the panel of tab hook 2</TabPanel>
      </TabPanels>
    </div>
  )
}
```
