import { Props } from '../../../Shared'

`Tree`, like `Accordion`, is a collapsible section component designed for hiding and showing content. However, unlike `Accordion`, `Tree` has a more structured interface and is best used when building tree views like a file structure or a sidebar.

Use the required `label` prop to set the text of the `Tree`'s disclosure.

To further customize the look of the `Tree`'s disclosure, you can use the `icon`, `iconSize`, and `detail` props.

Passing in an element into the `detail` prop will result in that element being displayed right of the `Tree`'s label.

**Note:** Use the `detailStopPropagation` prop if you would like to prevent `Tree` opening and closing when the `detail` element is clicked.

```jsx
<Tree
  label="Orders"
  icon="Table"
  detail={<Text variant="subdued">thelook</Box>}
>
  <TreeItem icon="FieldNumber">Cost</TreeItem>
  <TreeItem icon="FieldDistance">Location</TreeItem>
  <TreeItem icon="FieldTier">Tier</TreeItem>
  <TreeItem icon="FieldYesNo">Oui ou Non</TreeItem>
</Tree>
```

Use the `border` prop if you would like to have vertical lines expand from your `Tree`'s indicator icon when open.

```jsx
<Tree
  border
  label="Orders"
  icon="Table"
  detail={<Text variant="secondary">thelook</Text>}
  defaultOpen
>
  <Tree label="Created" defaultOpen>
    <TreeItem>Created Date</TreeItem>
    <TreeItem>Created Month</TreeItem>
    <TreeItem>Created Year</TreeItem>
    <TreeItem>Created Quarter</TreeItem>
  </Tree>
</Tree>
```

## Nesting Trees

You can nest trees within each other by passing a `Tree` in as child of the parent `Tree`.

```jsx
<Tree label="Orders" icon="Table">
  <Tree label="Created">
    <TreeItem>Created Date</TreeItem>
    <TreeItem>Created Month</TreeItem>
    <TreeItem>Created Year</TreeItem>
    <TreeItem>Created Quarter</TreeItem>
  </Tree>
</Tree>
```

## Tree Callbacks

Use the `onOpen` and `onClose` props if you would like to trigger callbacks on `Tree` open or close, respectively.

```jsx
<Tree
  onOpen={() => alert('Open!')}
  onClose={() => alert('Close!')}
  label="Cheese"
  icon="Table"
>
  <TreeItem>Gouda</TreeItem>
</Tree>
```

## Controlling a Tree

Like `Accordion`, a `Tree` can be either uncontrolled or controlled.

By default, the `Tree` is an uncontrolled component and maintains its own opened/closed state. If you are using an uncontrolled `Tree` and want it initially open, use the `defaultOpen` prop.

However, you can use the `isOpen` and `toggleOpen` props to explicitly control the state of your `Tree`.

When the `isOpen` prop receives `true`, your `Tree` will reveal its content. When `false`, your content will be hidden.

The `toggleOpen` prop should receive a function that has one parameter: a boolean. When the `Tree`'s disclosure is clicked, the `toggleOpen` callback will be triggered and passed the opposite boolean of the current `isOpen` prop value.

```jsx
;() => {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(true)

  return (
    <Tree label="Orders" icon="Table" isOpen={isOpen} toggleOpen={setIsOpen}>
      <TreeItem icon="FieldNumber">Cost</TreeItem>
      <TreeItem icon="FieldDistance">Location</TreeItem>
      <TreeItem icon="FieldTier">Tier</TreeItem>
      <TreeItem icon="FieldYesNo">Oui ou Non</TreeItem>
    </Tree>
  )
}
```

## TreeItem

<Props of="TreeItem" />

`TreeItem` is used to create branches in a tree view; it is best used as the direct child of a `<Tree>`.

Unlike `Tree`, `TreeItem` has no `label` prop and instead displays its child as its content.

In addition, `TreeItem` can accept a callback via its `onClick` prop.

Use the `detail` prop to display a detail element right of the `TreeItem`'s content.

To prevent clicks on the `detail` element from triggering the `onClick` callback, use the `detailStopPropagation` prop.

`icon` and `iconSize` can be used to create and customize an icon element left of the `TreeItem`'s content.

Use `gapSize` to control the distance between elements in your `TreeItem`.

```jsx
<Tree label="Cheeses" defaultOpen>
  <TreeItem
    icon="LogoRings"
    detail={<Text variant="text4">is great</Text>}
    onClick={() => alert('Clicked Swiss')}
  >
    Swiss
  </TreeItem>
</Tree>
```
