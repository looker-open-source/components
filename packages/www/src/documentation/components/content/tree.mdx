import { Props } from '../../../Shared'

`<Tree>`, like `<Accordion>`, is a collapsible section component designed for hiding and showing content.

However, unlike `<Accordion>`, `<Tree>` has a more structured interface and is best used when building tree views like a file structure or a sidebar.

Use the `label` prop to set the text of the `<Tree>`'s disclosure. Note that this prop is required.

To further customize the look of the `<Tree>`'s disclosure, you can use the `icon`, `iconSize`, and `detail` props.

Passing in an icon name into the `icon` prop will result in an icon being displayed left of the `<Tree>`'s label.

Passing in an element into the `detail` prop will result in that element being displayed right of the `<Tree>`'s label.

**Note:** Use the `detailStopPropagation` prop if you would like to prevent `<Tree>` opening and closing when the `detail` element is clicked.

```jsx
<Tree
  label="Orders"
  icon="Table"
  detail={<Box color="palette.charcoal500">thelook</Box>}
>
  <TreeItem icon="FieldNumber">Cost</TreeItem>
  <TreeItem icon="FieldDistance">Location</TreeItem>
  <TreeItem icon="FieldTier">Tier</TreeItem>
  <TreeItem icon="FieldYesNo">Oui ou Non</TreeItem>
</Tree>
```

Use the `border` prop if you would like to have vertical lines expand from your `<Tree>`'s indicator icon when open.

**Note:** Using the `border prop` on a `<Tree>` will enable the vertical lines on all child `<Tree>`s.

```jsx
<Tree
  border
  label="Orders"
  icon="Table"
  detail={<Box color="palette.charcoal500">thelook</Box>}
  defaultOpen
>
  <Tree label="Created" defaultOpen>
    <TreeItem>Created Date</TreeItem>
    <TreeItem>Created Month</TreeItem>
    <TreeItem>Created Year</TreeItem>
    <TreeItem>Created Quarter</TreeItem>
  </Tree>
</Tree>
```

## Nesting Trees

You can nest trees within each other by passing `<Tree>`s in as children to parent `<Tree>`s.

```jsx
<Tree label="Orders" icon="Table">
  <Tree label="Created">
    <TreeItem>Created Date</TreeItem>
    <TreeItem>Created Month</TreeItem>
    <TreeItem>Created Year</TreeItem>
    <TreeItem>Created Quarter</TreeItem>
  </Tree>
</Tree>
```

## Tree Callbacks

Use the `onOpen` and `onClose` props if you would like to trigger callbacks on `<Tree>` open or close, respectively.

```jsx
<Tree
  onOpen={() => alert('Open!')}
  onClose={() => alert('Close!')}
  label="Cheese"
  icon="Table"
>
  <TreeItem>Gouda</TreeItem>
</Tree>
```

## Controlling a Tree

Like `<Accordion>`, a `<Tree>` can be either uncontrolled or controlled.

By default, the `<Tree>` is an uncontrolled component and maintains its own opened/closed state. If you are using an uncontrolled `<Tree>` and want it initially open, use the `defaultOpen` prop.

However, you can use the `isOpen` and `toggleOpen` props to explicitly control the state of your `<Tree>`.

When the `isOpen` prop receives `true`, your `<Tree>` will reveal its content. When `false`, your content will be hidden.

The `toggleOpen` prop should receive a function that has one parameter: a boolean. When the `<Tree>`'s disclosure is clicked, the `toggleOpen` callback will be triggered and passed the opposite boolean of the current `isOpen` prop value.

```jsx
;() => {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(true)

  return (
    <Tree label="Orders" icon="Table" isOpen={isOpen} toggleOpen={setIsOpen}>
      <TreeItem icon="FieldNumber">Cost</TreeItem>
      <TreeItem icon="FieldDistance">Location</TreeItem>
      <TreeItem icon="FieldTier">Tier</TreeItem>
      <TreeItem icon="FieldYesNo">Oui ou Non</TreeItem>
    </Tree>
  )
}
```

## TreeItem

<Props of="TreeItem" />

`<TreeItem>` is used to create branches in a tree view; it is best used as the direct child of a `<Tree>`.

Unlike `<Tree>`, `<TreeItem>` has no `label` prop and instead displays its child as its content.

In addition, `<TreeItem>` can accept a callback via its `onClick` prop.

Use the `detail` prop to display a detail element right of the `<TreeItem>`'s content.

To prevent clicks on the `detail` element from triggering the `onClick` callback, use the `detailStopPropagation` prop.

`icon` and `iconSize` can be used to create and customize an icon element left of the `<TreeItem>`'s content.

Use `gapSize` to control the distance between elements in your `<TreeItem>`.

```jsx
<Tree label="Cheeses" defaultOpen>
  <TreeItem
    icon="LogoRings"
    detail={<Box color="palette.charcoal500">is great</Box>}
    onClick={() => alert('Clicked Swiss')}
  >
    Swiss
  </TreeItem>
</Tree>
```
