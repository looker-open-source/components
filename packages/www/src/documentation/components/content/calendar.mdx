`Calendar` is a stateless component which renders a standard calendar month. It accepts a limited amount of props, and is the foundation of our more useful [`InputDate`](/components/forms/input-date) and `InputDateRange` components.

```jsx
<Calendar />
```

## Props

`Calendar` shares many of the same props as `InputDate`. Please [view those docs](/components/forms/input-date) for interactive examples. But if you wish to use Calendar to build fully custom experiences, the following props are available for you:

<CalendarPropTable />
