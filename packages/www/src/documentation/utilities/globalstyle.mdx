title: GlobalStyle

import { Banner } from '@looker/components'

This component provides a basic set of styles to enable Looker Components. While not strictly required, failing to import this component will degrade the appearance of some components.

`GlobalStyle` will apply style broadly and may have impacts on other content. In the future we will provide a way to scope the GlobalStyle to only apply to HTML output by `@looker/components` but for the time-being the assumption is that the CSS applied is narrow in it's behavior and should have limited side-effects.

It's composed of two primary pieces:

## Default Font

The GlobalStyle component will assign the theme's "brand" font family ('Open Sans' in Looker's default theme) broadly across all components except a few that explicitly specify something different (`<Code>` for example leverages what's specified in theme.font.code)

<Banner>
  Note that the `GlobalStyle` component will not load any fonts specified. Refer
  to the <a href="/getting-started">Getting Started</a> documentation for font
  import recommendations.
</Banner>

## CSS Reset

- Apply CSS' `box-sizing: border-box` to all elements
- Sets base font-size to 16px (true for all modern browsers but helps establish a consistent baseline)
- Broadly resets basic element styles so that cross-browser styling is consistent.
