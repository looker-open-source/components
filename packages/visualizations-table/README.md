# @looker/visualizations-table

This package stores the default table visualization used within the Looker Visualization Components library.

## Installation

If you are working with Looker Visualizations Components, you will likely not need to reference the this package directly. But if you would like to import `Table` to extend or use outside of that context you can install it with Yarn or NPM:

- **NPM:** `npm install @looker/visualizations-table`
- **YARN:** `yarn add @looker/visualizations-table`

You'll also need to satisfy a few peer dependencies - Looker/components, React, and Styled Components:

- **NPM:** `npm install @looker/components react react-dom styled-components`
- **YARN:** `yarn add @looker/components react react-dom styled-components`

## Getting Started

```jsx
import { Table } from '@looker/visualizations-table'
```

Please see the documentation for [@looker/visualizations](https://github.com/looker-open-source/components/tree/main/packages/visualizations) for instructions on getting started with Looker Visualization Components. After that, be sure to check out the [Looker Developer Portal](https://developers.looker.com/components/visualization-components) to see `Table` configuration options, or view the [extension framework documentation](https://docs.looker.com/data-modeling/extension-framework/vis-components) for more advanced usage.
