# @looker/visualizations-adapters

This is a low-level package used within the Looker Visualizations Components library. This package contains all the types, utilities, data transformations, and adapters, which are agnostic to any one charting library and will be referenced by other higher-level packages.

## Installation

If you are working with Looker Visualizations Components, you will likely not need to reference the `visualizations-adapters` library directly. But if the need arises, you can install this package with Yarn or npm:

- **npm:** `npm install @looker/visualizations-adapters`
- **YARN:** `yarn add @looker/visualizations-adapters`

You'll also need to satisfy a few peer dependencies - React and Styled Components:

- **npm:** `npm install react react-dom styled-components`
- **YARN:** `yarn add react react-dom styled-components`

## Getting Started
