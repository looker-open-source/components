### Added

- `DataTable` (the component formerly known as `ActionList`)
  - Columns now support `size`
    - If `small`, `medium` or `large` is specified the content will be truncated to fit
    - If `nowrap` column will not wrap white-space and will grow fit content width
  - Responsive support - if table exceeds viewport width it will scroll sideways
    - `firstColumnStuck` developer can specify if the first column should "stick" to the viewport edge when scrolling
    - NOTE: Column for checkbox selection and actions column are always stuck to their respective edges
  - Column selection - the user can select which columns are displayed (if any columns have `hide` specified in their configuration)
  - Supports `state="loading|noResults"` and `noResultsDisplay`
- `autoFocus` prop will now work for inputs in `Popover` and `Dialog`

  - Now uses a `table` element instead of previous grid layout (IE11 compatible)
  - Vertical cadence of `ActionList` reduced to a minimum of `36px`
- `Popover`, `Menu`, and `Select` no longer cancel the first click outside by default (use `cancelClickOutside` to override this)
- `DialogContent` no longer has `py` unless it overflows the available space (acting as `overflow: scroll`)

- `MenuItems` within the same `MenuList` align consistently when icons are used
- `Page` fix size to use `%` instead of `vh/vw`
- `Popover` flashing in the upper left corner of the screen on slow pages
- `Select` on a mobile device or with "tap to click" on a touch pad reopens immediately after clicking on an option
- `Select` options not being announced in a screen reader on keyboard navigation
- `Select` that is controlled no longer loses focus if there's delay between `onChange` and `value` update

- `Select` inappropriately shows "No options" when the current value is empty, after filtering a long list down to a single option then deleting the filter text
- `Select` remounts its options when the options prop changes, using a shallow comparison. This causes select via click to fail if the options prop "changes" (same values, new array instance) after a mousedown, e.g. if a parent component contains `usePopover`.

### Removed

  - `delay` prop controls the length
  - Improved test coverage / added image-snapshots
- `Tree` `branchAlign` prop allows item be indented at the same depth as adjacent `TreeItem`(s)
- `Tree` now supports `dividers` to produce a small visual space between each `TreeItem` displayed in the list so that adjacent items in a "selected" or active state have visual separation.

### Changed

  - IMPORTANT NOTE: Popover will no longer apply `active` className to target. Instead it now applies `[aria-expanded='true']` instead. `Button*` has been updated to match this change but implementations that depend on the previous behavior will need to be updated.
- `Select` / `SelectMulti` / `InputTimeSelect` click to select option in IE11

### Removed
