# [1.0.0](https://github.com/looker-open-source/components/compare/v0.18.0...v1.0.0) (2021-03-22)

### BREAKING CHANGE

- **Icon**: Changes how Icons are used within @looker/components, shipped within @looker/components and leveraged by downstream consumers.

Fundamentally this changes icons from being a key/name (e.g.: "Calendar") to an SVG or component `<Calendar />`. Looker Components now leverages [Styled Icons](https://github.com/styled-icons/styled-icons) to provide types and design patterns as well as providing a complete set of "stock" Google Material icons.

  - IMPORTANT NOTE: Popover will no longer apply `active` className to target. Instead it now applies `[aria-expanded='true']` instead. `Button*` has been updated to match this change but implementations that depend on the previous behavior will need to be updated.
- `Select` / `SelectMulti` / `InputTimeSelect` click to select option in IE11

### Removed

### Added

- `InlineInputText` component
- `Select` now supports grouped options with a `title` and option `description`, as well as `FlexboxProps` for layout styling.
- `InputDate` and `Calendar` components
- Download icon
- Documentation in the icons package README that describes the recommended way to name icons

### Changed

- `Select` now only defaults to the first option if neither `placeholder` nor `isClearable` is defined.
- Removed images with unknown ownership in documentation

### Fixed

- Corrected links to source in documentation
- `Select` styling issues when `GlobalStyle` is not used, missing down caret icon in documentation
- `usePopover`, when the toggle was a mousedown event, would open just before the "click outside" listener was able to close any prior popovers. If both popovers were inside a `Modal`, the closing popover would re-enable the parent scroll lock, and the one that just opened would be un-scrollable. This especially affected multiple `Select`s inside a `Modal`.
