# VisuallyHidden

This component will hide the contents from the screen. The main use for this component is to provide accessible content to visual elements of a UI, for example adding a screen reader accessible label to an icon.

```jsx
<VisuallyHidden>You won't see me, but I'm in the DOM</VisuallyHidden>
```
