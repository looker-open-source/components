 * Advanced Use: Protect Unsaved User Changes
 *
 * If your dialog content includes form inputs it's entirely possible that the user
 * could unintentionally close the dialog and lose their unsaved changes. With careful
 * management of dialog and form state, you can add a second stage dialog to alert the
 * user to unsaved changes and protect them from losing their work.
