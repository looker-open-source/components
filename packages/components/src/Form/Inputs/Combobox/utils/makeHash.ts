// We don't want to track the active descendant with indexes because nothing is
// more annoying in a select than having it change values RIGHT AS YOU HIT
// ENTER. That only happens if you use the index as your data, rather than
// *your data as your data*. We use this to generate a unique ID based on the
// value of each item.  This function is short, sweet, and good enough™
