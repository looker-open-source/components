# @looker/visualizations-single-value

This package stores the default Single Value visualization used within the Looker Visualization Components library.

## Installation

If you are working with Looker Visualizations Components, you will likely not need to reference the this package directly. But if you would like to import `SingleValue` to extend or use outside of that context you can install it with npm or Yarn:

- **npm:** `npm install @looker/visualizations-single-value`
- **Yarn:** `yarn add @looker/visualizations-single-value`

You'll also need to satisfy a few peer dependencies - Looker/components, React, and Styled Components:

- **npm:** `npm install @looker/components react react-dom styled-components`
- **Yarn:** `yarn add @looker/components react react-dom styled-components`

## Getting Started

```jsx
import { SingleValue } from '@looker/visualizations-single-value';
```

Please see the documentation for [@looker/visualizations](https://github.com/looker-open-source/components/tree/main/packages/visualizations) for instructions on getting started with Looker Visualization Components. After that, be sure to check out the [Looker Developer Portal](https://developers.looker.com/components/visualization-components) to see the supported configuration options, or view the [extension framework documentation](https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/data-modeling/extension-framework/vis-components) for more advanced usage.
