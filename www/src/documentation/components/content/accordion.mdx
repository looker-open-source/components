`<Accordion>` hides and shows content on click like a collapsible section.

The `<Accordion>` component in particular acts as a wrapper and context provider for its companion components, `<AccordionDisclosure>` and `<AccordionContent>`.

Use the `onClose` and `onOpen` props if you would like to trigger callbacks on `<Accordion>` open or close.

If you want your `<Accordion>` open by default, use the `defaultOpen` prop.

**Note:** `defaultOpen` should only be used when using an uncontrolled `<Accordion>`. For more details on controlled `<Accordion>`s, see the "Controlling an Accordion" section.

```jsx
<Accordion>
  <AccordionDisclosure>Show me the cheese!</AccordionDisclosure>
  <AccordionContent>Cheddar</AccordionContent>
</Accordion>

<Accordion defaultOpen onClose={() => alert('Closing doors')} onOpen={() => alert('Opening doors')}>
  <AccordionDisclosure>Show me some other cheese!</AccordionDisclosure>
  <AccordionContent>Swiss</AccordionContent>
</Accordion>
```

## AccordionDisclosure

<Props of="AccordionDisclosure" />

Clicking on an `<AccordionDisclosure>` controls the appearance of its sibling `<AccordionContent>`.

The child of `<AccordionDisclosure>` is rendered as a label, and can be either be a `string` or a `ReactNode`.

```jsx
<Accordion indicatorPosition="left">
  <AccordionDisclosure>
    <Space between align="center">
      <span>Cheese is...</span>
      <Icon color="neutral" name="CircleQuestionOutline" size={20} />
    </Space>
  </AccordionDisclosure>
  <AccordionContent>pretty great</AccordionContent>
</Accordion>
```

## AccordionContent

<Props of="AccordionDisclosure" />

`<AccordionContent>` acts as the container for an `<Accordion>`'s content.

## Styling an Accordion's indicator

You can customize an `<Accordion>` indicator icon's size, position, and icon type via props.

Use the `indicatorPosition` prop to set the indicator's position on either the left or right side of the `<AccordionDisclosure>`.

```jsx
<Accordion indicatorPosition="left">
  <AccordionDisclosure>Show me the cheese!</AccordionDisclosure>
  <AccordionContent>Cheddar</AccordionContent>
</Accordion>
```

Use the `indicatorSize` prop to set the size of your indicator.

```jsx
<Accordion indicatorSize="xxlarge">
  <AccordionDisclosure>Show me the cheese!</AccordionDisclosure>
  <AccordionContent>Cheddar</AccordionContent>
</Accordion>
```

Use the `indicatorIcons` prop to customize which icons represent an open or closed `<Accordion>`.

By default, the `CaretDown` and `CaretUp` `<Icon>`s are used.

```jsx
<Accordion indicatorIcons={{ close: 'Close', open: 'FieldYesNo' }}>
  <AccordionDisclosure>Show me the cheese!</AccordionDisclosure>
  <AccordionContent>Cheddar</AccordionContent>
</Accordion>
```

## Controlling an Accordion

By default, the `<Accordion>` is an uncontrolled component and maintains its own opened/closed state.

However, you can use the `isOpen` and `toggleOpen` props to explicitly control the state of your `<Accordion>`.

When the `isOpen` prop receives `true`, your `<Accordion>` will reveal its content. When `false`, your content will be hidden.

The `toggleOpen` prop should receive a function that has one parameter: a boolean. When the `<AccordionDisclosure>` is clicked, the `toggleOpen` callback will be triggered and passed the opposite boolean of the current `isOpen` prop value.

```jsx
;() => {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(true)

  return (
    <Accordion isOpen={isOpen} toggleOpen={setIsOpen}>
      <AccordionDisclosure>Show me the cheese!</AccordionDisclosure>
      <AccordionContent>Cheddar</AccordionContent>
    </Accordion>
  )
}
```
