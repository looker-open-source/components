`<Accordion>` hides and shows content on click like a collapsible section.

The child of `<Accordion>` is rendered as a label on the disclosure, and can be either be a `string` or a `ReactNode`.

The `content` prop determines what content is hidden or shownby the `<Accordion>`.

Use the `id` prop to set the ID of the `<Accordion>`. In addition, IDs will be auto-generated for the underlying disclosure element and content container element based on `<Accordion>`'s ID.

Use the `onClose` and `onOpen` props if you would like to trigger callbacks on `<Accordion>` open or close.

If you want your `<Accordion>` open by default, use the `defaultOpen` prop.

**Note:** `defaultOpen` should only be used when using an uncontrolled `<Accordion>`. For more details on controlled `<Accordion>`s, see the "Controlling an Accordion" section.

```jsx
<Accordion content="Cheddar">
  Show me the cheese!
</Accordion>

<Accordion defaultOpen onClose={() => alert('Closing doors')} onOpen={() => alert('Opening doors')} content="Swiss">
  Show me some other cheese!
</Accordion>
```

## Basic Accordion behavior

Clicking on an `<Accordion>`'s disclosure controls the appearance of its content.

```jsx
<Accordion indicatorPosition="left" content="pretty great">
  <Space between align="center">
    <span>Cheese is...</span>
    <Icon color="neutral" icon={<Help />} size={20} />
  </Space>
</Accordion>
```

## Styling an Accordion's indicator

You can customize an `<Accordion>` indicator icon's size, position, and icon type via props.

Use the `indicatorPosition` prop to set the indicator's position on either the left or right side of the disclosure.

```jsx
<Accordion indicatorPosition="left" content="Cheddar">
  Show me the cheese!
</Accordion>
```

Use the `indicatorSize` prop to set the size of your indicator.

```jsx
<Accordion indicatorSize="xxlarge" content="Cheddar">
  Show me the cheese!
</Accordion>
```

Use the `color` prop to customize the color of the indicator and any text.

```jsx
<Accordion color="key" content="Cheddar">
  Show me the cheese!
</Accordion>
```

Use the `indicatorIcons` prop to customize which icons represent an open or closed `<Accordion>`.

By default, the `CaretDown` and `CaretUp` `<Icon>`s are used.

```jsx
<Accordion
  indicatorIcons={{ close: 'Close', open: 'FieldYesNo' }}
  content="Cheddar"
>
  Show me the cheese!
</Accordion>
```

## Controlling an Accordion

By default, the `<Accordion>` is an uncontrolled component and maintains its own opened/closed state.

However, you can use the `isOpen` and `toggleOpen` props to explicitly control the state of your `<Accordion>`.

When the `isOpen` prop receives `true`, your `<Accordion>` will reveal its content. When `false`, your content will be hidden.

The `toggleOpen` prop should receive a function that has one parameter: a boolean. When the disclosure is clicked, the `toggleOpen` callback will be triggered and passed the opposite boolean of the current `isOpen` prop value.

```jsx
;() => {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(true)

  return (
    <Accordion isOpen={isOpen} toggleOpen={setIsOpen} content="Cheddar">
      Show me the cheese!
    </Accordion>
  )
}
```
