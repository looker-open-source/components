  Accordion has been deprecated and replaced with

    Accordion2
  </Code> please update any existing instances to use the new improved version. Deprecation
  of `Accordion` is planned for @looker/components 3.0
</MessageBar>

`<Accordion2>` hides and shows `children` on click like a collapsible section.

The `label` of `<Accordion2>` is always visible and acts as the trigger to toggle the accordion. `label` can be either be a `string` or a `ReactNode`.

The `children` determines what content is hidden or shown by the accordion.

Use the `id` prop to set the ID of the `<Accordion2>`. In addition, IDs will be auto-generated for the underlying disclosure element and content container element based on `<Accordion2>`'s ID.

Use the `onClose` and `onOpen` props if you would like to trigger callbacks on `<Accordion2>` open or close.

If you want your `<Accordion2>` open by default, use the `defaultOpen` prop.

**Note:** `defaultOpen` should only be used when using an uncontrolled `<Accordion2>`. For more details on controlled `<Accordion2>`s, see the "Controlling an Accordion" section.

```jsx
<Accordion2 label="Show me the cheese!">
  Cheddar
</Accordion2>

<Accordion2 defaultOpen onClose={() => alert('Closing doors')} onOpen={() => alert('Opening doors')} label="Show me some other cheese!">
  Swiss
</Accordion2>
```

## Basic Accordion behavior

Clicking on an `<Accordion2>`'s label controls the appearance of its content.

```jsx
<Accordion2
  indicatorPosition="left"
  label={
    <Space between align="center">
      <span>Cheese is...</span>
      <Icon color="neutral" icon={<Help />} size={20} />
    </Space>
  }
>
  pretty great
</Accordion2>
```

## Styling an Accordion's indicator

You can customize an `<Accordion>` indicator icon's size, position, and icon type via props.

Use the `indicatorPosition` prop to set the indicator's position on either the left or right side of the disclosure.

NOTE: `indicatorPosition="left"` will also change the default `indicatorIcons` as shown below.

```jsx
<Accordion2 indicatorPosition="left" label="Show me the cheese!">
  Cheddar
</Accordion2>
```

Use the `indicatorSize` prop to set the size of your indicator.

```jsx
<Accordion2 indicatorSize="xxlarge" label="Show me the cheese!">
  Cheddar
</Accordion2>
```

Use the `indicatorIcons` prop to customize which icons represent an open or closed `<Accordion2>`.

By default, the `CaretDown` and `CaretUp` `<Icon>`s are used.

```jsx
<Accordion2
  indicatorIcons={{ close: 'Close', open: 'FieldYesNo' }}
  label="Show me the cheese!"
>
  Cheddar
</Accordion2>
```

## Controlling an Accordion

By default, the `<Accordion2>` is an uncontrolled component and maintains its own opened/closed state.

However, you can use the `isOpen` and `toggleOpen` props to explicitly control the state of your `<Accordion2>`.

When the `isOpen` prop receives `true`, your `<Accordion2>` will reveal its content. When `false`, your content will be hidden.

The `toggleOpen` prop should receive a function that has one parameter: a boolean. When the disclosure is clicked, the `toggleOpen` callback will be triggered and passed the opposite boolean of the current `isOpen` prop value.

```jsx
;() => {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(true)

  return (
    <Accordion2
      isOpen={isOpen}
      toggleOpen={setIsOpen}
      label="Show me the cheese!"
    >
      Cheddar
    </Accordion2>
  )
}
```
