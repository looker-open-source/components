The `Chip` component is a compact element that can be set as `disabled` and has `onDelete` availabel, it can be triggered by clicking or `onKeyDown` backspace.

```jsx
;() => {
  const alertTrigger = () => alert('hello')
  return (
    <Space gap="xxsmall">
      <Chip>first chip</Chip>
      <Chip>
        this is a very long text that shows the word wrapping in a chip
      </Chip>
      <Chip disabled>disabled chip</Chip>
      <Chip onDelete={alertTrigger}>deletable</Chip>
    </Space>
  )
}
```

The `Chip` component provides the prop `chipIconLabel` to customize the icon label. Hover over the the `x` icon to see the tooltip.

```jsx
<Space gap="xxsmall">
  <Chip chipIconLabel="not delete">hover the x</Chip>
  <Chip>hover the x</Chip>
</Space>
```
