title: Breakpoint

The `Breakpoint` component is used to render content at a desired screen size. While css breakpoints or styled-system responsive values should cover the vast majority of use cases, this component is provided to facilitate larger markup or behaviors tailored to the device.

We support five named breakpoints as follows:

import { NamedBreakpointTable } from './demos'

<NamedBreakpointTable />

## From, To

You can specify a range of screensizes using the `from`, and `to` props. Default values are `mobile` and `xl`, respectively.

Resize the screen to watch the values change.

```jsx
  <Breakpoint from="mobile" to="mobile">
    Mobile Only
  </Breakpoint>
  <Breakpoint from="tablet" to="desktop">
    Tablet, Laptop, and Desktop
  </Breakpoint>
  <Breakpoint from="xl">Only large screens</Breakpoint>
```
