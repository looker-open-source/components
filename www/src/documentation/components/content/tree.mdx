`Tree`, like `Accordion`, is a collapsible section component designed for hiding and showing content. However, unlike `Accordion`, `Tree` has a more structured interface and is best used when building tree views like a file structure or a sidebar.

Use the required `label` prop to set the text of the `Tree` disclosure. `label` alternatively accepts a `ReactNode` for more advanced layouts.

Use the `icon` prop to display an icon next to the `Tree` label.

```jsx
<Tree label="Orders" icon="Table">
  <TreeItem icon="FieldNumber">Cost</TreeItem>
  <TreeItem icon="FieldLocation">Location</TreeItem>
  <TreeItem icon="FieldTier">Tier</TreeItem>
  <TreeItem icon="FieldYesNo">Oui ou Non</TreeItem>
</Tree>
```

Use `detail` to display an element in the negative space of the `Tree` label.

```jsx
<Tree
  label="Orders"
  icon="Table"
  detail={
    <IconButton
      icon="CircleInfo"
      label="Get Info"
      onClick={() => alert("You've got info!")}
    />
  }
>
  <TreeItem icon="FieldNumber">Cost</TreeItem>
</Tree>
```

Use the `branchFontWeight` prop if you'd like your `Tree`'s disclosure text to have a "normal" font weight.

Use the `branchAlign` prop to prevent your nested `Tree` from being indented so its label is vertically aligned with adjacent `TreeItem`s.

These is especially useful when you want a nested `Tree` to match its sibling `TreeItem`s

```jsx
<Tree label="Orders" icon="Table" defaultOpen>
  <Tree branchAlign branchFontWeight label="Created" defaultOpen>
    <TreeItem>Created Date</TreeItem>
    <TreeItem>Created Month</TreeItem>
    <TreeItem>Created Year</TreeItem>
    <TreeItem>Created Quarter</TreeItem>
  </Tree>
  <TreeItem>Cost</TreeItem>
  <TreeItem>Location</TreeItem>
  <TreeItem>ID</TreeItem>
</Tree>
```

Use the `border` prop if you would like to have vertical lines expand from your `Tree`'s indicator icon when open.

```jsx
<Tree border label="Orders" icon="Table" defaultOpen>
  <Tree label="Created" defaultOpen>
    <TreeItem>Created Date</TreeItem>
    <TreeItem>Created Month</TreeItem>
    <TreeItem>Created Year</TreeItem>
    <TreeItem>Created Quarter</TreeItem>
  </Tree>
</Tree>
```

## Truncating Tree Items & Labels

Occasionally tree item labels will wrap to a second line when the text content is very long, or the available space is very narrow. The text content will wrap by default, but if that is undesirable you can use the `truncate` prop to limit text content to a single line.

When text content overflows, it will render a tooltip to view the entire content, which is consistent with the [Truncate](/components/text/truncate) component.

```jsx
<Heading>Default Text Wrapping Layout</Heading>
<Tree
  border
  label="A very long label that wraps to a second line. Both the label and the tree item will wrap to two or more lines because there is just too much text."
  icon="Table"
  defaultOpen
>
  <TreeItem icon="IdeDimension">
    <strong>Very long text wraps content.</strong> Cheese is a dairy product, derived from milk and produced in wide ranges of flavours, textures and forms by coagulation of the milk protein casein. It comprises proteins and fat from milk, usually the milk of cows, buffalo, goats, or sheep.
  </TreeItem>

</Tree>
```

```jsx
<Heading>Truncated Text</Heading>
<Tree
  border
  label="A very label that wraps to a second line. Sometimes you don't want to take up extra vertical space, and instead it will cut off the text."
  truncate
  icon="Table"
  defaultOpen
>
  <TreeItem icon="IdeDimension" truncate>
    <strong>Very long text renders a tooltip.</strong> Hover over me for a tooltip of the full content. Cheese is a dairy product, derived from milk and produced in wide ranges of flavours, textures and forms by coagulation of the milk protein casein. It comprises proteins and fat from milk, usually the milk of cows, buffalo, goats, or sheep.
  </TreeItem>
</Tree>
```

## Nesting Trees

You can nest trees within each other by passing a `Tree` in as a child of another `Tree`.

**Note:** `Tree` will automatically indent any child `Tree` and `TreeItem`s based on their depth in the hierarchy.

```jsx
<Tree label="Orders" icon="Table">
  <Tree label="Created">
    <TreeItem>Created Date</TreeItem>
    <TreeItem>Created Month</TreeItem>
    <TreeItem>Created Year</TreeItem>
    <TreeItem>Created Quarter</TreeItem>
  </Tree>
</Tree>
```

## Tree Callbacks

Use the `onOpen` and `onClose` props if you would like to trigger callbacks on `Tree` open or close, respectively.

```jsx
<Tree
  onOpen={() => alert('Open!')}
  onClose={() => alert('Close!')}
  label="Cheese"
  icon="Table"
>
  <TreeItem>Gouda</TreeItem>
</Tree>
```

## Controlling a Tree

Like `Accordion`, a `Tree` can be either uncontrolled or controlled.

By default, the `Tree` is an uncontrolled component and maintains its own opened/closed state. If you are using an uncontrolled `Tree` and want it initially open, use the `defaultOpen` prop.

However, you can use the `isOpen` and `toggleOpen` props to explicitly control the state of your `Tree`.

When the `isOpen` prop receives `true`, your `Tree` will reveal its content. When `false`, your content will be hidden.

The `toggleOpen` prop should receive a function that has one parameter: a boolean. When the `Tree`'s disclosure is clicked, the `toggleOpen` callback will be triggered and passed the opposite boolean of the current `isOpen` prop value.

```jsx
;() => {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(true)

  return (
    <Tree label="Orders" icon="Table" isOpen={isOpen} toggleOpen={setIsOpen}>
      <TreeItem icon="FieldNumber">Cost</TreeItem>
      <TreeItem icon="FieldLocation">Location</TreeItem>
      <TreeItem icon="FieldTier">Tier</TreeItem>
      <TreeItem icon="FieldYesNo">Oui ou Non</TreeItem>
    </Tree>
  )
}
```

## TreeItem

`TreeItem` is used to create branches in a tree view; it is best used as the direct child of a `<Tree>`.

Unlike `Tree`, `TreeItem` has no `label` prop and instead displays its child as its content. In addition, `TreeItem` accepts a callback via its `onClick` prop rather than `onOpen` and `onClose` props.

Use the `detail` prop to display a detail element right of the `TreeItem`'s content.

Use the `icon` prop to display an icon left of the `TreeItem`'s content.

Use the `gapSize` prop to control the distance between elements in your `TreeItem`.

Use the `selected` prop to display a light grey background on a given `TreeItem`.

Use the `onClick` prop to trigger a callback on click or when pressing the "Enter" key on a focused `TreeItem`.

Use the `onMetaEnter` prop to trigger a callback when pressing the "Enter" key in combination with the meta key (i.e. "Command" or "Windows" key) on a focused `TreeItem`.

```jsx
<Tree label="Cheeses" defaultOpen>
  <TreeItem
    icon="LogoRings"
    detail={<Text variant="text2">is great</Text>}
    onClick={() => alert('Clicked Swiss')}
    onMetaEnter={() => alert('Clicked Swiss while holding meta key')}
    selected
  >
    Swiss
  </TreeItem>
</Tree>
```

## Customizing Detail Elements on Tree and TreeItem

You can customize the look and behavior of `detail` elements using the `detailAccessory` and `detailHoverDisclosure` props.

When `detailAccessory` is true, events on `detail` elements will not propagate.

In addition, when `detailAccessory` is true, the hover background will not apply to the `detail` elements.

```jsx
;() => {
  const detail = (
    <>
      <IconButton
        icon="Filter"
        label="Filter"
        onClick={() => alert('Filter')}
      />
      <IconButton
        icon="CircleInfoOutline"
        label="Info"
        onClick={() => alert('Info')}
      />
      <IconButton
        icon="DotsVert"
        label="Options"
        onClick={() => alert('Options')}
      />
    </>
  )

  return (
    <Tree label="Orders" icon="Table" defaultOpen detailAccessory>
      <TreeItem icon="FieldNumber" detail={detail}>
        Cost
      </TreeItem>
      <TreeItem icon="FieldLocation" detail={detail}>
        Location
      </TreeItem>
      <TreeItem icon="FieldTier" detail={detail}>
        Tier
      </TreeItem>
    </Tree>
  )
}
```

Setting `detailAccessory` on a parent `Tree` will also apply it to all child `TreeItem`s, as seen above.

However, you can override a parent `Tree`'s `detailAccessory` prop at the `TreeItem` level.

```jsx
;() => {
  const detail = (
    <>
      <IconButton
        icon="Filter"
        label="Filter"
        onClick={() => alert('Filter')}
      />
      <IconButton
        icon="CircleInfoOutline"
        label="Info"
        onClick={() => alert('Info')}
      />
      <IconButton
        icon="DotsVert"
        label="Options"
        onClick={() => alert('Options')}
      />
    </>
  )

  return (
    <Tree label="Orders" icon="Table" defaultOpen detailAccessory>
      <TreeItem icon="FieldNumber" detail={detail} detailAccessory={false}>
        Cost
      </TreeItem>
      <TreeItem icon="FieldLocation" detail={detail}>
        Location
      </TreeItem>
      <TreeItem icon="FieldTier" detail={detail}>
        Tier
      </TreeItem>
    </Tree>
  )
}
```

Use `detailHoverDisclosure` to hide and show `detail` elements on hover.

```jsx
;() => {
  const detail = (
    <>
      <IconButton
        icon="Filter"
        label="Filter"
        onClick={() => alert('Filter')}
      />
      <IconButton
        icon="CircleInfoOutline"
        label="Info"
        onClick={() => alert('Info')}
      />
      <IconButton
        icon="DotsVert"
        label="Options"
        onClick={() => alert('Options')}
      />
    </>
  )

  return (
    <Tree
      label="Orders"
      icon="Table"
      defaultOpen
      detailHoverDisclosure
      detail="thelook"
    >
      <TreeItem icon="FieldNumber" detail={detail}>
        Cost
      </TreeItem>
      <TreeItem icon="FieldLocation" detail={detail}>
        Location
      </TreeItem>
      <TreeItem icon="FieldTier" detail={detail}>
        Tier
      </TreeItem>
    </Tree>
  )
}
```

Setting `detailHoverDisclosure` on a parent `Tree` will apply it to all child `TreeItem`s.

However, you can override a parent `Tree`'s `detailHoverDisclosure` prop at the `TreeItem` level.

```jsx
;() => {
  const detail = (
    <>
      <IconButton
        icon="Filter"
        label="Filter"
        onClick={() => alert('Filter')}
      />
      <IconButton
        icon="CircleInfoOutline"
        label="Info"
        onClick={() => alert('Info')}
      />
      <IconButton
        icon="DotsVert"
        label="Options"
        onClick={() => alert('Options')}
      />
    </>
  )

  return (
    <Tree
      label="Orders"
      icon="Table"
      defaultOpen
      detailHoverDisclosure
      detail="thelook"
    >
      <TreeItem
        icon="FieldNumber"
        detail={detail}
        detailHoverDisclosure={false}
      >
        Cost
      </TreeItem>
      <TreeItem icon="FieldLocation" detail={detail}>
        Location
      </TreeItem>
      <TreeItem icon="FieldTier" detail={detail}>
        Tier
      </TreeItem>
    </Tree>
  )
}
```

## TreeGroup

`TreeGroup` can be used to label a grouping of `TreeItem`s. `TreeGroup` should be the child of a `Tree`and the parent of one or many `TreeItem`s.

Use the `label` prop to set the text label of the `TreeGroup`.

Use the `color` prop to set the text color of both the `TreeGroup` and all of its children.

```jsx
<Tree label="Cheeses" defaultOpen>
  <TreeGroup label="American">
    <TreeItem icon="LogoRings">Cream</TreeItem>
    <TreeItem icon="LogoRings">Pepper Jack</TreeItem>
    <TreeItem icon="LogoRings">String Cheese</TreeItem>
  </TreeGroup>
  <TreeGroup label="English" color="inform">
    <TreeItem icon="LogoRings">Brighton Blue</TreeItem>
    <TreeItem icon="LogoRings">Cheddar</TreeItem>
    <TreeItem icon="LogoRings">Suffolk Gold</TreeItem>
  </TreeGroup>
</Tree>
```
