Popovers are containers for things like contextual information, menus, and related actions.

## Terminology

Popovers are assembled of two pieces: an overlay and a surface. Unlike [Dialogs](/components/dialogs/), the `Popover` overlay is transparent, but it still blocks the application behind it until it is closed, with the exception of [grouped Popovers](#grouped-popovers). The `Popover`'s surface renders the content above the overlay and the rest of the application.

```jsx
<Popover
  content={
    <PopoverContent p="large" width="360px">
      <Heading>Wildebeest</Heading>

      <Text fontSize="small">
        The blue wildebeest, also called the common wildebeest, white-bearded
        wildebeest or brindled gnu, is a large antelope and one of the two
        species of wildebeest. It is placed in the genus Connochaetes and family
        Bovidae and has a close taxonomic relationship with the black
        wildebeest. The blue wildebeest is known to have five subspecies. This
        broad-shouldered antelope has a muscular, front-heavy appearance, with a
        distinctive robust muzzle. Young blue wildebeest are born tawny brown,
        and begin to take on their adult colouration at the age of two months.
        The adults' hues range from a deep slate or bluish gray to light gray or
        even grayish brown. Both sexes possess a pair of large curved horns.
      </Text>
    </PopoverContent>
  }
>
  <Button>A Wikipedia article about Wildebeests</Button>
</Popover>
```

## Placement

Placement can be adjusted with the `placement` prop. Valid positions are `top`, `left`, `right` and `bottom`, each can be augmented with -`start` or `-end` which places the edge of the popover at the start or end of the target.

```jsx
;() => {
  const popoverContent = (
    <PopoverContent>
      <Paragraph width={300} p="xxlarge">
        👋 Hello, I am a popover!
      </Paragraph>
    </PopoverContent>
  )

  return (
    <SpaceVertical>
      <Space between width="100%">
        <Popover content={popoverContent}>
          <Button>Default</Button>
        </Popover>
        <Popover content={popoverContent} placement="right">
          <Button>Right</Button>
        </Popover>
        <Popover content={popoverContent} placement="left">
          <Button>Left</Button>
        </Popover>
      </Space>
      <Space between width="100%">
        <Popover content={popoverContent} placement="bottom-start">
          <Button>Bottom Start</Button>
        </Popover>
        <Popover content={popoverContent} placement="right-end">
          <Button>Right End</Button>
        </Popover>
        <Popover content={popoverContent} placement="top-start">
          <Button>Top Start</Button>
        </Popover>
      </Space>
    </SpaceVertical>
  )
}
```

## Disclosing the Trigger on Hover

```jsx
;() => {
  const hoverRef = React.useRef()
  const content = <PopoverContent p="large">I'm in the popover</PopoverContent>
  return (
    <Card ref={hoverRef} raised>
      <CardContent>
        <Space between>
          <Paragraph>
            Hovering in this card will show the button that triggers the
            popover.
          </Paragraph>
          <Popover content={content} hoverDisclosureRef={hoverRef}>
            <IconButton icon="DotsVert" label="More Options" />
          </Popover>
        </Space>
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  )
}
```

## PopoverContent

`PopoverContent` is a simple container component that can be used to apply a consistent style to content placed within a Popover surface.

## "Render Prop" style

Sometimes you may need to control how `Tooltip` applies handlers to the component within it. If so you can use the render prop form of the component:

```jsx
<Popover content="Example using render props exploded">
  {(props) => (
    <Button {...props}>
      Render Props Example: {props['aria-expanded'] ? 'open' : 'closed'}
    </Button>
  )}
</Popover>
```
