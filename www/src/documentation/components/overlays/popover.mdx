Popovers are containers for things like contextual information, menus, and related actions.

## Terminology

Popovers are assembled of two pieces: an overlay and a surface. Unlike [Dialogs](/components/dialogs/), the `Popover` overlay is transparent, but it still blocks the application behind it until it is closed, with the exception of [grouped Popovers](#grouped-popovers). The `Popover`'s surface renders the content above the overlay and the rest of the application.

```jsx
<Popover
  content={
    <PopoverContent p="large" width="360px">
      <Heading>Wildebeest</Heading>

      <Text fontSize="small">
        The blue wildebeest, also called the common wildebeest, white-bearded
        wildebeest or brindled gnu, is a large antelope and one of the two
        species of wildebeest. It is placed in the genus Connochaetes and family
        Bovidae and has a close taxonomic relationship with the black
        wildebeest. The blue wildebeest is known to have five subspecies. This
        broad-shouldered antelope has a muscular, front-heavy appearance, with a
        distinctive robust muzzle. Young blue wildebeest are born tawny brown,
        and begin to take on their adult colouration at the age of two months.
        The adults' hues range from a deep slate or bluish gray to light gray or
        even grayish brown. Both sexes possess a pair of large curved horns.
      </Text>
    </PopoverContent>
  }
>
  <Button>A Wikipedia article about Wildebeests</Button>
</Popover>
```

## Placement

Placement can be adjusted with the `placement` prop. Valid positions are `top`, `left`, `right` and `bottom`, each can be augmented with -`start` or `-end` which places the edge of the popover at the start or end of the target.

```jsx
;() => {
  const popoverContent = (
    <PopoverContent>
      <Paragraph width={300} p="xxlarge">
        ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I am a popover!
      </Paragraph>
    </PopoverContent>
  )

  return (
    <SpaceVertical>
      <Space between width="100%">
        <Popover content={popoverContent}>
          <Button>Default</Button>
        </Popover>
        <Popover content={popoverContent} placement="right">
          <Button>Right</Button>
        </Popover>
        <Popover content={popoverContent} placement="left">
          <Button>Left</Button>
        </Popover>
      </Space>
      <Space between width="100%">
        <Popover content={popoverContent} placement="bottom-start">
          <Button>Bottom Start</Button>
        </Popover>
        <Popover content={popoverContent} placement="right-end">
          <Button>Right End</Button>
        </Popover>
        <Popover content={popoverContent} placement="top-start">
          <Button>Top Start</Button>
        </Popover>
      </Space>
    </SpaceVertical>
  )
}
```

## Grouped Popovers

By default Popover cancels event bubbling when a click event triggers the closure of the Popover. \* This was deemed a best practice as it prevents inadveted destructive actions and mirrors behavior seen in many commonly used applications (e.g. Chrome).

However, where several related Popover components are grouped together, cancelling event bubbling for the "dismissal click" can make for an awkward UX. This functionality is used for items grouped to create a larger navigation component or associated controls such as a collection of filters.

To create a group, assigned a reference to an containing element and then assign the reference to that element to `groupedPopoversRef` on each `Popover`. This will override the `Popover` component's usual behavior of cancelling event propagation on the clicks outside of the `Portal` associated with the `Popover`. The first click outside of the `Portal` will still close the `Popover` but click event propagation or otherwise suppressed and instead will be allowed to produce its usual behavior.

```jsx
;() => {
  const groupRef = React.useRef()
  const content = (
    <PopoverContent p="large" width="360px">
      Example Popover text.
    </PopoverContent>
  )
  return (
    <Space>
      <Space
        around
        ref={groupRef}
        p="large"
        style={{ border: '3px solid green' }}
      >
        <Popover content={content} groupedPopoversRef={groupRef}>
          <Button>Instant Click</Button>
        </Popover>
        <Popover content={content} groupedPopoversRef={groupRef}>
          <Button mx="large">Instant Click</Button>
        </Popover>
        <Popover content={content}>
          <ButtonOutline>Defer Click</ButtonOutline>
        </Popover>
      </Space>
      <Popover content={content}>
        <ButtonTransparent mx="xlarge" my="large">
          Outside Group
        </ButtonTransparent>
      </Popover>
    </Space>
  )
}
```

## Disclosing the Trigger on Hover

```jsx
;() => {
  const hoverRef = React.useRef()
  const content = <PopoverContent p="large">I'm in the popover</PopoverContent>
  return (
    <Card ref={hoverRef} raised>
      <CardContent>
        <Space between>
          <Paragraph>
            Hovering in this card will show the button that triggers the
            popover.
          </Paragraph>
          <Popover content={content} hoverDisclosureRef={hoverRef}>
            <IconButton icon="DotsVert" label="More Options" />
          </Popover>
        </Space>
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  )
}
```

## PopoverContent

`PopoverContent` is a simple container component that can be used to apply a consistent style to content placed within a Popover surface.

## "Render Prop" style

Sometimes you may need to control how `Tooltip` applies handlers to the component within it. If so you can use the render prop form of the component:

```jsx
<Popover content="Example using render props exploded">
  {(props) => (
    <Button {...props}>
      Render Props Example: {props['aria-expanded'] ? 'open' : 'closed'}
    </Button>
  )}
</Popover>
```
