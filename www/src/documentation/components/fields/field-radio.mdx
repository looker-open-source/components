The `<FieldRadio />` component is composed of a `<Radio />` component and a `<Label />` component. Using `<FieldRadio />` allows for rendering validation messages. By default, the label will render to the right of the radio button, however this is adjustable with the `inline` property.

```jsx
<FieldRadio name="radio" label="Radio" />
<FieldRadio name="radio" label="Radio 2" inline />
```
