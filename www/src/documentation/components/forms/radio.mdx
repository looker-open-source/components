The `<Radio />` component renders a single radio button on the page, with no accompanying label. It is generally used to construct higher-order components like the `<FieldRadio />`. If you are building a form, you probably want to use `<FieldRadio />` instead as it provides label support.

## Checked Property

The `<Radio />` component accepts the `checked` property, which either sets the radio button as selected or not.

```jsx
<Space>
  <Radio defaultChecked={false} />
  <Radio defaultChecked />
</Space>
```

## Disabled Property

Use the disable property to gray out the radio button, making it un-clickable.

```jsx
<Space>
  <Radio disabled />
  <Radio disabled checked />
</Space>
```

## Name and ID

A name and ID can be specified in the `<Radio />` component. Radio buttons of the same `name` are considered to be in a 'radio group' and only one radio button in a radio group can be selected at a time.

```jsx
<Space>
  <Radio name="someName" id="one" value="one" />
  <Radio name="someName" id="two" value="two" />
  <Radio name="someName" id="three" value="three" />
</Space>
```
