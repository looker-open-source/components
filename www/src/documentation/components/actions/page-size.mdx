At its core, `<PageSize/>` is a composition of `<Select/>` and `<Text/>`.

A typical use case of `<PageSize/>` is to set the number of viewable items on each page in a paginated list.

Regarding implementation details, a `<PageSize/>` element will call the callback it received via its `onChange` prop any time a user selects a new options from the `<Select/>`, passing in the newly selected value.

```jsx
;() => {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(10)
  return (
    <PageSize
      value={value}
      options={[5, 10, 20, 50]}
      total={100}
      onChange={setValue}
    />
  )
}
```
