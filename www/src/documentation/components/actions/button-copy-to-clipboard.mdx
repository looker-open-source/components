`CopyToClipboard` button copies a string pass as `content` prop to clipboard.

```jsx
<CopyToClipboard content="here is some text to be copied" />
```

### Label

`CopyToClipboard` offers props `children` and `success` both can be used to change the labels on the button by passing a string.

```jsx
<CopyToClipboard 
  content="here is some text to be copied" 
  success="'it was copied'"
>
  Copy Something'
</CopyToClipboard>
```

### Customize Components

`CopyToClipboard` `children` and `success` support taking a `JSX.Element` instead of a simple string if you prefer.```

```jsx
<CopyToClipboard 
  content="here is some text to be copied" 
  success={<Button>Success</Button>}
>
  <Button>Copy stuff</Button>
</CopyToClipboard>
```
