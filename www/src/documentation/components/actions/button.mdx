Use a default button for the most frequently used action or most important action on a page. Default buttons should only appear once on a page. They are sometimes accompanied by a secondary button.

```jsx
<Button>Default Button</Button>
```

## Color

`Key` is the primary brand color, which is the default setting.

```jsx
<Space>
  <Button color="key">Key</Button>
</Space>
```

`Critical` Buttons are to be used in situations where you need to convey some very important, potentially irreversible consequence of pressing this button.

```jsx
<Space>
  <Button color="critical">Critical</Button>
</Space>
```

`Neutral` buttons are meant to fade into the background. These are usually used for secondary, nonessential, actions.

```jsx
<Space>
  <Button color="neutral">Neutral</Button>
</Space>
```

## Size

Use the size property on a `<Button />` to modify the size the button rendered. You can combine it with the `mode` property to get the correct style and size of button you need.

```jsx
<Space>
  <Button size="xsmall">Xsmall Button</Button>
  <Button size="small">Small Button</Button>
  <Button>Medium (default) Button</Button>
  <Button size="large">Large Button</Button>
</Space>
```

## Full Width

Use the `fullWidth` property on a `<Button />` and it will set its width to 100%.

```jsx
<SpaceVertical>
  <Button fullWidth>Full Width</Button>
</SpaceVertical>
```

## Disabled

Use a disabled button to indicate to the user what action will be possible on a page once a prerequisite action is taken. Disabled buttons do not respond to user interaction.

```jsx
<Button disabled>I am disabled</Button>
```

## Icons

Buttons can have an icon before or after their content, using the `iconBefore` and `iconAfter` property. Each property accepts the [name of an icon](/#!/Icons)

```jsx
<Space>
  <Button iconBefore="CircleAdd">Add To Cart</Button>
  <Button iconAfter="Trash" color="critical">
    Delete
  </Button>
</Space>
```

## Style Guide

### Additional Action

When a call to action requires additional steps, include an ellipsis at the end of the button text as a visual clue. This helps reinforce that there are additional steps that can take place before the action takes effect.

```jsx
<Space>
  <Button color="critical">Move to Trash...</Button>
  <Button>Print...</Button>
</Space>
```
