```jsx
<CopyToClipboard content="here is some text to be copied" />
```

### Label

`CopyToClipboard` offers props `children` and `success` both can be used to change the labels on the button by passing a string

```jsx
<CopyToClipboard
  content="here is some text to be copied"
  success="it was copied"
>
  Copy Something
</CopyToClipboard>
```

### Customize Components

`CopyToClipboard` `children` and `success` support taking a `JSX.Element` instead of a simple string if you prefer

```jsx
<CopyToClipboard
  content="here is some text to be copied"
  success={<Button>Success</Button>}
>
  <Button>Copy stuff</Button>
</CopyToClipboard>
```
