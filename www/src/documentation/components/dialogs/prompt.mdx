The `<Prompt/>` component is similar to the `<Confirm/>` component in that you can use either to render a dialog.

However, unlike the `<Confirm/>`, the `<Prompt/>` component comes with a built in `<InputText/>` component. This makes it more suitable for use cases where you want to grab user input before performing an action.

```jsx
<Prompt
  title={'Choose a cheese!'}
  inputLabel={'Name of Cheese'}
  onCancel={(close) => {
    alert('Prompt closed')
    close()
  }}
  onSave={(value, close) => {
    alert(`You chose ${value}`)
    close()
  }}
>
  {(open) => <Button onClick={open}>Prompt</Button>}
</Prompt>
```
