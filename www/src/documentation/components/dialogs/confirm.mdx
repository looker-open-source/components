Confirm provides a helpful composition of dialog components to drive the most common use case: driving user action to confirm or cancel a specific outcome.

# Standard Use

Confirm makes use of the render prop pattern to provide `open` and `close` functions to be called when needed.

```jsx
<Confirm
  title="Confirm Something"
  message="Is this what you want to do?"
  onConfirm={(close) => {
    alert('You did something')
    close()
  }}
>
  {(open) => <Button onClick={open}>Do Something</Button>}
</Confirm>
```

Updating color and text of the button

```jsx
<Confirm
  confirmLabel="Delete"
  buttonColor="critical"
  title="Delete Something"
  message="Is this what you want to do?"
  onConfirm={(close) => {
    alert('You deleted something')
    close()
  }}
>
  {(open) => (
    <Button color="critical" onClick={open}>
      Delete
    </Button>
  )}
</Confirm>
```

# useConfirm

If you want more control over markup and state, we provide a custom hook that returns the opener function and rendered confirmation dialog. The following example illustrates how the opener can be called outside the Confirm component.

```jsx
;() => {
  function handleConfirm(close) {
    alert('You deleted it')
    close()
  }

  const [confirmationDialog, openDialog] = useConfirm({
    confirmLabel: 'Yes, Delete all',
    buttonColor: 'critical',
    title: `Delete all`,
    message: 'Are you sure you want to delete all?',
    onConfirm: handleConfirm,
  })

  return (
    <>
      {confirmationDialog}
      <ButtonOutline onClick={openDialog}>useConfirm</ButtonOutline>
    </>
  )
}
```

# ConfirmLayout

We've found that most Dialogs involve the same common elements: Title, Message, a primary action (usually "Confirm"), and a secondary action (usually "Cancel").

To help standardize that layout, we created the `ConfirmLayout` component for composing the relevant pieces. This is handy if you need something like Confirm in a separate context (e.g. when you need to lay out surface content for use in [`Dialog`](/components/dialogs/dialog)).

```jsx
;() => {
  function handleConfirm() {
    alert('Changes discarded')
  }
  function handleCancel() {
    alert('Went back')
  }

  return (
    <ConfirmLayout
      title="Discard Changes?"
      titleIcon={<Icon name="Warning" color="critical" size={22} />}
      message="Are you sure you want to close the dialog? Unsaved changes will be lost."
      primaryButton={
        <Button onClick={handleConfirm} color="critical">
          Discard Changes
        </Button>
      }
      secondaryButton={
        <ButtonTransparent onClick={handleCancel} color="neutral">
          Go Back
        </ButtonTransparent>
      }
    />
  )
}
```
