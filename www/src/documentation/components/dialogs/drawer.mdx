Drawer is a specialized form of `Dialog` that is attached to the edge of the viewport.

NOTE: Currently `Drawer` only supports attachement to the right side of the viewport. Support for additional `placement` options is planned in the future.

# Standard Use

```jsx
<Drawer content="Something in the drawer">
  <Button>Open Drawer</Button>
</Drawer>
```

# useDrawer

We provide a custom hook that returns the opener function and rendered drawer.

```jsx
;() => {
  const { drawer, open } = useDrawer({
    content: 'Drawer Content',
  })

  return (
    <>
      {drawer}
      <ButtonOutline onClick={open}>Open Drawer</ButtonOutline>
    </>
  )
}
```

## Width

All variants of Drawer allow you to specify `width` - it can be specified as `xxsmall`, `xsmall`, `small`, `medium`, & `large`.

By default, `width` defaults to `small` so that Dialog Surface will conform to the width of its content.

## Placement

Determines how surface is positioned in the the viewport.

- `right` (default) - surface is centered horizontally and vertically above mobile breakpoint.
  - _mobile_: positioned at top of window and covers entire width.
  - _width_: defaults to 100% in mobile breakpoint and 37.5rem above that unless otherwise specified
  - _height_: fits content unless it's explicitly specified with `minHeight` prop
- `left` - positioned to cover nearly the entire window.
  - _mobile & tablet_: cover the entire window.
