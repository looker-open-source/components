Drawer is a specialized form of `Dialog` that is attached to the edge of the viewport.

NOTE: Currently `Drawer` only supports attachement to the right side of the viewport. Support for additional `placement` options is planned in the future.

# Standard Use

```jsx
<Drawer content="Something in the drawer">
  <Button>Open Drawer</Button>
</Drawer>
```

# useDrawer

We provide a custom hook that returns the opener function and rendered drawer.

```jsx
;() => {
  const { drawer, open } = useDrawer({
    content: 'Drawer Content',
  })

  return (
    <>
      {drawer}
      <ButtonOutline onClick={open}>Open Drawer</ButtonOutline>
    </>
  )
}
```
