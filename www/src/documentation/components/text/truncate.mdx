import { Paragraph, MessageBar } from '@looker/components'

`Truncate` can be used when you want to prevent text from wrapping. Text will be limited to a single line, and if it overflows an ellipsis will be rendered. In addition, a tooltip will be activated to display the full text on hover.

<MessageBar intent="warn" noActions>
  <strong>Caveat:</strong> the direct parent of this component must have a width
  or max-width styled on it or else it will invisibly overflow without rendering
  the proper ellipsis.
</MessageBar>

<Paragraph>&nbsp;</Paragraph>

```jsx
<Truncate>
  <strong>Hover over text to see the full content:</strong> Earliest proposed
  dates for the origin of cheesemaking range from around 8000 BCE, when sheep
  were first domesticated. Since animal skins and inflated internal organs have,
  since ancient times, provided storage vessels for a range of foodstuffs, it is
  probable that the process of cheese making was discovered accidentally by
  storing milk in a container made from the stomach of an animal, resulting in
  the milk being turned to curd and whey by the rennet from the stomach. There
  is a legend—with variations—about the discovery of cheese by an Arab trader
  who used this method of storing milk.
