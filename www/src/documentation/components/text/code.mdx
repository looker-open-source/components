Renders a inline level `<code />` element on the page.

```jsx
<Paragraph>
  Some text with code: <Code>const noop = () => null</Code>
</Paragraph>
```

## CodeBlock

A `CodeBlock` is a dedicated container for multiple lines of source code. It produces un-styled code with whitespace preserved.

NOTE: Currently, this component doesn't support syntax highlighting.

```jsx
;() => {
  const exampleText = `const fauxCode = 'not real'

if (lookMa != fauxCode) {
  // Some stuff could happen here.
  // This comment is really long and should force the container to scroll to the side in most cases.
} else {
  // or it could happen here...
}`

  return <CodeBlock>{exampleText}</CodeBlock>
}
```
