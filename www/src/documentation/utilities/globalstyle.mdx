title: GlobalStyle
---

This component provides a basic set of styles to enable Looker Components. While not strictly required, failing to import this component will degrade the appearance of some components.

`GlobalStyle` will apply style broadly and may have impacts on other content. In the future we will provide a way to scope the GlobalStyle to only apply to HTML output by `@looker/components` but for the time-being the assumption is that the CSS applied is narrow in it's behavior and should have limited side-effects.

NOTE: The `ComponentsProvider` will automatically load the `GlobalStyle` component for you.

## CSS Reset

- Apply CSS' `box-sizing: border-box` to all elements
- Sets base font-size to 16px (true for all modern browsers but helps establish a consistent baseline)
- Broadly resets basic element styles so that cross-browser styling is consistent.
