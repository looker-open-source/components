import { ElevationList } from './demos/ElevationList'

Elevation helps reinforce a UI's hierarchy though layering and depth, it uses shadows to simulate distance between two surfaces.

### Levels

We support six levels of elevation, from plus0 to plus5. To use the elevation you can access it on theme like `theme.elevations.{level}`, for example to apply level 3 elevation you would use `theme.elevations.plus3`
