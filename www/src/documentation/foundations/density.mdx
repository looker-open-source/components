Density is a foundational property of certain Looker Components and it plays a key role in how easy it is for a user to scan and navigate large amounts of content. Adjusting a component’s density changes its overall height and space it takes up in a UI. The higher the density, the smaller the height of the component.

In general Looker Components that support density adjustments start at a medium density and offer the ability to increase or decrease density depending on the context and needs of the experience.

A couple key things to keep in mind when using density are:

- Density should be adjusted at the top most level component and should not be mixed, for example:
  - Adjust density on the `<List />` component, not it’s `<ListItem />` children.
  - Do not combine a high density and low density `MenuItem`s, in the same `Menu`
- High density components will not pass accessibility requirements, so use it judiciously and only where high density improves the experience

## Components that support density

Currently only list like components support density, this includes `<List />`, `<Menu />`, and `<Tree />`


<DensityTable />
