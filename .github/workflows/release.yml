name: Release & Publish NPM Packages

# This workflow does the following if repo does not have git tag that was updated in lerna.json
#  - creates release git tag
#  - publishes packages to NPM with latest tag
#  - publishes version documentation to web site and aliases /latest to release version
#
# This workflow is expected to run after merge of release pull requested created by release-pull-request workflow.
